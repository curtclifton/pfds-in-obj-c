# Purely Functional Data Structures in Objective-C

I'm on a quixotic quest to work through Chris Okasaki's [Purely Functional Data Structures](http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki-ebook/dp/B00AKE1V04), implementing all the examples and exercises in Objective-C. This makes little sense, but if you're curious, I wrote [a bit on my blog](http://www.curtclifton.net/journal/2014/3/4/three-threads.html) about why I'm tilting at this particular windmill.

I haven't decided exactly how to organize this code yet, so stuff may move around. My apologies if that makes anything hard to follow. I'll try to lean heavily on version control to track work by chapter while organizing the code as if it might be used practically. I'm going to try to push branches to github for each chapter while letting *master* track my overall progress through the book.
